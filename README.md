Python notebooks to accompany the paper 'Non-survivable heat stress conditions are already occurring'

Compound age and heat is used to make the maps showing the bivariate plots combining heat risk and population density.

US_Case_Studies is used to make the scatterplot and timeseries plots for each of the case studies. 

Further code and information about the model used to calculate the survivable limits can be found in the following paper:
